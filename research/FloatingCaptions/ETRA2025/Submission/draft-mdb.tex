\section{Introduction}
ACM's consolidated article template, introduced in 2017, provides a
consistent \LaTeX\ style for use across ACM publications, and
incorporates accessibility and metadata-extraction functionality
necessary for future Digital Library endeavors. Numerous ACM and
SIG-specific \LaTeX\ templates have been examined, and their unique
features incorporated into this single new template.

If you are new to publishing with ACM, this document is a valuable
guide to the process of preparing your work for publication. If you
have published with ACM before, this document provides insight and
instruction into more recent changes to the article template.

The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class can be used to prepare articles
for any ACM publication --- conference or journal, and for any stage
of publication, from review to final ``camera-ready'' copy, to the
author's own version, with {\itshape very} few changes to the source.

\section{Template Overview}
As noted in the introduction, the ``\verb|acmart|'' document class can
be used to prepare many different kinds of documentation --- a
double-anonymous initial submission of a full-length technical paper, a
two-page SIGGRAPH Emerging Technologies abstract, a ``camera-ready''
journal article, a SIGCHI Extended Abstract, and more --- all by
selecting the appropriate {\itshape template style} and {\itshape
  template parameters}.

This document will explain the major features of the document
class. For further information, the {\itshape \LaTeX\ User's Guide} is
available from
\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template}.

\section{Related Works}
\subsection{Wearable and Tangible Interfaces for Subtle Emotional Communication}
Wearable devices and ambient interfaces have been widely explored as mediums to convey emotions in subtle ways. For example, \cite{li2020ambient} conducted a study on wearable ambient displays for long-distance couples using co-design workshops and field trials with low-fidelity prototypes. Their methodology involved participants designing and testing lightweight wearable cues (e.g., jewelry-like devices) to communicate intimacy. The key finding was that such limited-vocabulary wearables can increase awareness and emotional connectedness without being intrusive. In a related study, \cite{li2020workshop} organized a hands-on workshop with 12 long-distance couples who built wearable concepts (e.g., rings and bracelets). Qualitative analysis of the prototypes revealed design considerations for emotional wearables such as supporting secretive cues and effortless awareness. Another work by \cite{li2020secret} introduced \emph{Our Little Secret}, an ambient picture frame that communicates mood through subtle luminous patterns. Their evaluation through lab interviews and in-the-wild deployment showed that participants valued its unobtrusive, always-on design.

Beyond visual cues, researchers have designed tactile devices to share affective signals. \cite{werner2008unitedpulse} developed \emph{United-Pulse}, a pair of rings that transmit the wearer’s heartbeat in real time. Their prototype, tested with 28 users, demonstrated that even a subtle heartbeat signal can create a feeling of closeness. In an earlier project, \cite{brave1997intouch} introduced \emph{inTouch}, a networked system using wooden rollers that move synchronously to enable remote tactile interaction. Cheok et al. \cite{cheok2012huggy} later designed \emph{Huggy Pajama}, a wearable jacket that reproduces a parent’s hug for a distant child using inflatable actuators. 

Rantala et al. \cite{rantala2013squeeze} studied how tactile gestures convey emotion using a custom squeeze-responsive device. Their controlled experiment revealed that firm squeezes and gentle touches can respectively communicate high-arousal negative and low-arousal positive emotions. A complementary two-week field study by \cite{kim2019haptic} provided couples with haptic bracelets that transmitted squeeze-like touches. Results indicated enhanced feelings of connectedness though the technology did not fully replace physical contact. Additional studies have examined mediated touch: \cite{saadatian2014mediated} and \cite{park2013nudging} found that even subtle haptic signals (like a gentle nudge) can be emotionally meaningful. Huisman et al. \cite{huisman2013tass} proposed \emph{TaSST}, a tactile sleeve for simulating stroking, while Smith and MacLean \cite{smith2007mediated} discussed the contextual factors affecting the perception of mediated touch. Furthermore, research by \cite{bailenson2007haptics}, \cite{takahashi2011touch}, and \cite{vanerp2015virtual} demonstrated that even in virtual environments, mediated haptics can transmit emotional information that increases intimacy and sympathy.
In computer-mediated communication (CMC), researchers have identified creative methods to convey emotion subtly despite the absence of physical cues. Carter \cite{carter2003nonverbal} coined the term “quasi-nonverbal cues” to describe textual elements—such as emoticons, punctuation, and formatting—that function similarly to body language in face-to-face interactions. His observational study noted that such cues help prevent misinterpretation of emotion in text-based media. However, issues like the “neutrality effect” can still occur, where positive messages without obvious cues are perceived as emotionally flat.

\subsection{Assistive and Inclusive Technologies for Emotional Expression and Recognition}
Assistive technologies also harness subtle emotional representation to improve communication for users with sensory or social-cognitive challenges. Williams et al. \cite{williams2015swarm} developed \emph{SWARM}, an actuated wearable scarf that provides multisensory feedback (e.g., warmth, vibration, sound) corresponding to emotional states. Their user-centered design process, involving individuals with visual impairments, indicated that such devices can enhance self-awareness of emotions and foster emotional communication.

LaCava et al. \cite{lacava2007mindreading} piloted a software tool, \emph{Mind Reading: The Interactive Guide to Emotions}, to help children with Asperger’s Syndrome recognize and interpret emotional expressions. Their 10-week program produced significant improvements in emotion recognition across both facial and vocal cues. In another study, Garay-Vitoria et al. \cite{garay2006gestele} developed \emph{Gestele}, an assistive prototype for telephone conversations that modulated speech synthesis parameters to convey emotions. Their findings confirmed that with proper design, even mediated speech can carry enough emotional nuance to be effectively interpreted.

Robillard and Hoey \cite{robillard2018emotion} further argued for integrating explicit emotion models into cognitive assistive technologies, proposing a Bayesian framework (BayesACT) to help systems adapt to the user’s emotional state. Their conceptual work emphasized that even assistive devices must attend to subtle emotional alignment to be truly effective.

Finally, the concept of subtle emotional representation is further extended by \cite{zhang2020dailybadge} in their introduction of \emph{My Daily Badge}—a wearable accessory that uses biosignal data to generate graphical movements as social cues. 



\section{CCS Concepts and User-Defined Keywords}

Two elements of the ``acmart'' document class provide powerful
taxonomic tools for you to help readers find your work in an online
search.

The ACM Computing Classification System ---
\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/class-2012} --- is a set of
classifiers and concepts that describe the computing
discipline. Authors can select entries from this classification
system, via \url{https://dl.acm.org/ccs/ccs.cfm}, and generate the
commands to be included in the \LaTeX\ source.

User-defined keywords are a comma-separated list of words and phrases
of the authors' choosing, providing a more flexible way of describing
the research being presented.

CCS concepts and user-defined keywords are required for for all
articles over two pages in length, and are optional for one- and
two-page articles (or abstracts).

\section{Sectioning Commands}

Your work should use standard \LaTeX\ sectioning commands:
\verb|\section|, \verb|\subsection|, \verb|\subsubsection|,
\verb|\paragraph|, and \verb|\subparagraph|. The sectioning levels up to
\verb|\subsusection| should be numbered; do not remove the numbering
from the commands.

Simulating a sectioning command by setting the first word or words of
a paragraph in boldface or italicized text is {\bfseries not allowed.}

Below are examples of sectioning commands.

\subsection{Subsection}
\label{sec:subsection}

This is a subsection.

\subsubsection{Subsubsection}
\label{sec:subsubsection}

This is a subsubsection.

\paragraph{Paragraph}

This is a paragraph.

\subparagraph{Subparagraph}

This is a subparagraph.

\section{Tables}

The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class includes the ``\verb|booktabs|''
package --- \url{https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs} --- for preparing
high-quality tables.

Table captions are placed {\itshape above} the table.

Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best placement for
them is typically the top of the page nearest their initial cite.  To
ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and the
table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go in the
\textbf{tabular} environment, to be aligned properly in rows and
columns, with the desired horizontal and vertical rules.  Again,
detailed instructions on \textbf{tabular} material are found in the
\textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:freq} is included in the input file; compare the
placement of the table here with the table in the printed output of
this document.

\begin{table}
  \caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
  \label{tab:freq}
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \toprule
    Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\
    \midrule
    \O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\
    $\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\
    \$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\
    $\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of the page's
live area, use the environment \textbf{table*} to enclose the table's
contents and the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this
wide table will ``float'' to a location deemed more
desirable. Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:commands} is included in the input file; again, it is
instructive to compare the placement of the table here with the table
in the printed output of this document.

\begin{table*}
  \caption{Some Typical Commands}
  \label{tab:commands}
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \toprule
    Command &A Number & Comments\\
    \midrule
    \texttt{{\char'134}author} & 100& Author \\
    \texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\
    \texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table*}

Always use midrule to separate table header rows from data rows, and
use it only for this purpose. This enables assistive technologies to
recognise table headers and support their users in navigating tables
more easily.

\section{Math Equations}
You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of the three are
discussed in the next sections.

\subsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
A formula that appears in the running text is called an inline or
in-text formula.  It is produced by the \textbf{math} environment,
which can be invoked with the usual
\texttt{{\char'134}begin\,\ldots{\char'134}end} construction or with
the short form \texttt{\$\,\ldots\$}. You can use any of the symbols
and structures, from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
\LaTeX~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a few
examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how this equation:
\begin{math}
  \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
\end{math},
set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
set in display style.  (See next section).

\subsection{Display Equations}
A numbered display equation---one set off by vertical space from the
text and centered horizontally---is produced by the \textbf{equation}
environment. An unnumbered display equation is produced by the
\textbf{displaymath} environment.

Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols and
structures available in \LaTeX\@; this section will just give a couple
of examples of display equations in context.  First, consider the
equation, shown as an inline equation above:
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
\end{equation}
Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
the \textbf{displaymath}
environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
\begin{displaymath}
  \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1
\end{displaymath}
and follow it with another numbered equation:
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f
\end{equation}
just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.

\section{Figures}

The ``\verb|figure|'' environment should be used for figures. One or
more images can be placed within a figure. If your figure contains
third-party material, you must clearly identify it as such, as shown
in the example below.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{sample-franklin}
  \caption{1907 Franklin Model D roadster. Photograph by Harris \&
    Ewing, Inc. [Public domain], via Wikimedia
    Commons. (\url{https://goo.gl/VLCRBB}).}
  \Description{A woman and a girl in white dresses sit in an open car.}
\end{figure}

Your figures should contain a caption which describes the figure to
the reader.

Figure captions are placed {\itshape below} the figure.

Every figure should also have a figure description unless it is purely
decorative. These descriptions convey what’s in the image to someone
who cannot see it. They are also used by search engine crawlers for
indexing images, and when images cannot be loaded.

A figure description must be unformatted plain text less than 2000
characters long (including spaces).  {\bfseries Figure descriptions
  should not repeat the figure caption – their purpose is to capture
  important information that is not already provided in the caption or
  the main text of the paper.} For figures that convey important and
complex new information, a short text description may not be
adequate. More complex alternative descriptions can be placed in an
appendix and referenced in a short figure description. For example,
provide a data table capturing the information in a bar chart, or a
structured list representing a graph.  For additional information
regarding how best to write figure descriptions and why doing this is
so important, please see
\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/describing-figures/}.

\subsection{The ``Teaser Figure''}

A ``teaser figure'' is an image, or set of images in one figure, that
are placed after all author and affiliation information, and before
the body of the article, spanning the page. If you wish to have such a
figure in your article, place the command immediately before the
\verb|\maketitle| command:
\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{teaserfigure}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sampleteaser}
    \caption{figure caption}
    \Description{figure description}
  \end{teaserfigure}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Citations and Bibliographies}

The use of \BibTeX\ for the preparation and formatting of one's
references is strongly recommended. Authors' names should be complete
--- use full first names (``Donald E. Knuth'') not initials
(``D. E. Knuth'') --- and the salient identifying features of a
reference should be included: title, year, volume, number, pages,
article DOI, etc.

The bibliography is included in your source document with these two
commands, placed just before the \verb|\end{document}| command:
\begin{verbatim}
  \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
  \bibliography{bibfile}
\end{verbatim}
where ``\verb|bibfile|'' is the name, without the ``\verb|.bib|''
suffix, of the \BibTeX\ file.

Citations and references are numbered by default. A small number of
ACM publications have citations and references formatted in the
``author year'' style; for these exceptions, please include this
command in the {\bfseries preamble} (before the command
``\verb|\begin{document}|'') of your \LaTeX\ source:
\begin{verbatim}
  \citestyle{acmauthoryear}
\end{verbatim}


  Some examples.  A paginated journal article \cite{Abril07}, an
  enumerated journal article \cite{Cohen07}, a reference to an entire
  issue \cite{JCohen96}, a monograph (whole book) \cite{Kosiur01}, a
  monograph/whole book in a series (see 2a in spec. document)
  \cite{Harel79}, a divisible-book such as an anthology or compilation
  \cite{Editor00} followed by the same example, however we only output
  the series if the volume number is given \cite{Editor00a} (so
  Editor00a's series should NOT be present since it has no vol. no.),
  a chapter in a divisible book \cite{Spector90}, a chapter in a
  divisible book in a series \cite{Douglass98}, a multi-volume work as
  book \cite{Knuth97}, a couple of articles in a proceedings (of a
  conference, symposium, workshop for example) (paginated proceedings
  article) \cite{Andler79, Hagerup1993}, a proceedings article with
  all possible elements \cite{Smith10}, an example of an enumerated
  proceedings article \cite{VanGundy07}, an informally published work
  \cite{Harel78}, a couple of preprints \cite{Bornmann2019,
    AnzarootPBM14}, a doctoral dissertation \cite{Clarkson85}, a
  master's thesis: \cite{anisi03}, an online document / world wide web
  resource \cite{Thornburg01, Ablamowicz07, Poker06}, a video game
  (Case 1) \cite{Obama08} and (Case 2) \cite{Novak03} and \cite{Lee05}
  and (Case 3) a patent \cite{JoeScientist001}, work accepted for
  publication \cite{rous08}, 'YYYYb'-test for prolific author

\section{Acknowledgments}

Identification of funding sources and other support, and thanks to
individuals and groups that assisted in the research and the
preparation of the work should be included in an acknowledgment
section, which is placed just before the reference section in your
document.

This section has a special environment:
\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{acks}
  ...
  \end{acks}
\end{verbatim}
so that the information contained therein can be more easily collected
during the article metadata extraction phase, and to ensure
consistency in the spelling of the section heading.

Authors should not prepare this section as a numbered or unnumbered {\verb|\section|}; please use the ``{\verb|acks|}'' environment.

\section{Appendices}

If your work needs an appendix, add it before the
``\verb|\end{document}|'' command at the conclusion of your source
document.

Start the appendix with the ``\verb|appendix|'' command:
\begin{verbatim}
  \appendix
\end{verbatim}
and note that in the appendix, sections are lettered, not
numbered. This document has two appendices, demonstrating the section
and subsection identification method.

\section{Multi-language papers}

Papers may be written in languages other than English or include
titles, subtitles, keywords and abstracts in different languages (as a
rule, a paper in a language other than English should include an
English title and an English abstract).  Use \verb|language=...| for
every language used in the paper.  The last language indicated is the
main language of the paper.  For example, a French paper with
additional titles and abstracts in English and German may start with
the following command
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[sigconf, language=english, language=german,
               language=french]{acmart}
\end{verbatim}

The title, subtitle, keywords and abstract will be typeset in the main
language of the paper.  The commands \verb|\translatedXXX|, \verb|XXX|
begin title, subtitle and keywords, can be used to set these elements
in the other languages.  The environment \verb|translatedabstract| is
used to set the translation of the abstract.  These commands and
environment have a mandatory first argument: the language of the
second argument.  See \verb|sample-sigconf-i13n.tex| file for examples
of their usage.

\section{SIGCHI Extended Abstracts}

The ``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style (available only in \LaTeX\ and
not in Word) produces a landscape-orientation formatted article, with
a wide left margin. Three environments are available for use with the
``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style, and produce formatted output in
the margin:
\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{sidebar}:]  Place formatted text in the margin.
\item[\texttt{marginfigure}:] Place a figure in the margin.
\item[\texttt{margintable}:] Place a table in the margin.
\end{description}

%% The acknowledgments section is defined using the "acks" environment
%% (and NOT an unnumbered section). This ensures the proper
%% identification of the section in the article metadata, and the
%% consistent spelling of the heading.
\begin{acks}
To Robert, for the bagels and explaining CMYK and color spaces.
\end{acks}

%% The next two lines define the bibliography style to be used, and
%% the bibliography file.
